# DremJS
A web OS featuring 3rd party support, an IDE (coming soon!), and much more (coming soon too :v).

It's free and completly hosted on GitHub. No more building needed!!! Just fork the DremJS Repository and go to:

<code>yourusername.github.io/DremJS</code>

Alternatively, you can also download this and upload it to your own web server (as this project is open source and licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3). Just give credit for the original source code.
